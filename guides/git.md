### :dart: Why Git? (The Purpose)
---
- **Version control**: Git helps track changes to files and code over time.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
- **Backup & recovery**: Easily roll back to earlier versions if something breaks.
- **Branching**: Safely experiment with new features without affecting the main code.

### :rocket: What is Git? (The Tool)
---
- Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**.
- It stores **snapshots** of your project over time.
- Every developer has a **full copy** of the project history on their local machine.
- Git is the backbone of platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket**.

git add filename     # or use `.` to add everything
```

#### :shield: Commit changes (save a snapshot)
```bash
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
```

#### :triangular_ruler: Connect to a remote repository (like GitHub)
```bash
git remote add origin <repo-url>
```

#### :rocket: Push changes to remote
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

#### :brain: Pull changes from remote
```bash
git pull
```

#### :bulb: Create and switch branches
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
